#Correction Calculator

This is an HTML/javascript implementation of a correction calculator for type 1 diabetes. Given a set of options (effect of 1g glucose and 1 unit insulin), a current BG reading, and target BG, it will calculate the corrections needed.

Units are in mg/dL, and are rounded to the nearest 0.25.

I make no guarantees about this code; edits are welcome!
